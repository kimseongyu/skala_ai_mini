NICE suggests the software can be used while further evidence of their cost-effectiveness is collected. These tools are already prevalent, with AI deployed in 99 of 107 stroke units in England at the time of analysis. However, the approval comes with caution that the software should only be used alongside healthcare professionals and existing scan reporting protocols should be maintained to mitigate the risk of incorrect results."

        "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a pivotal role in aligning climate action with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of different nations, according to a research published in Nature Communications. This study shows significant patterns and disparities between emissions targets and sustainable development goals, mainly in high-emission, middle- and low-income nations. Thus, AI can promote policy coherence as it allows governments to uncover the interconnections between Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs). The integration of AI into national development strategies may lead to more sustainable economic growth and effective climate action."
